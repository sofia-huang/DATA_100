## Project 5
### Acquiring, Modifying and Describing the Data
In this project, I cropped and combined Rasters to produce a RasterStack. Next, I plotted some maps using the RasterStack object. Then I extracted data from the Raster and combined it with the country's adm2 object in order to be able to create histograms and density plots.
