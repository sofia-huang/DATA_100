## Project 3: Projecting, Plotting and Labelling Administrative Subdivisions
### Republic of Congo

This project required downloading shapefile data from GADM for a country of choice. I chose the Republic of Congo. Then, using the tidyverse, gglot2, and sf packages, I plotted the data on the country's administrative subdivisions. In the Republic of Congo, the ADM1 subdivisions are called departments and the ADM2 subdivisions are called districts.

*Since the two most densely populated departments of the country do not have ADM2 level subdivisions, I have included their neighboring department and its ADM2 subdivisions
