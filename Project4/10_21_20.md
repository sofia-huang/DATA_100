## Project 4: Extracting Populations from a Raster and Aggregating to each Unit
### Republic of Congo

For this project I had to subset the country I was doing because it had too many gridcells in the raster. So, my plots are all of the southern half of Congo where the two most populated cities are. This project is basically an extension of project 3. I took the shapefile data and combined it with raster data from WorldPop to model the population distribution of Congo.
