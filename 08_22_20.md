Here I created a simple plot using 2 objects, x & y, which contain the numbers 1-10, to generate the points. Then, I made specifications to the plot line and points, as well as adding labels and a title.

```
## Getting Started exercise pt. 1 ##

# make objects
x<-1:10
y<-10:1
# plot objects
plot(x, y, type = "b", 
  main = "The Path of a Running Boy", 
  sub = "units of distance = meters", 
  xlab = "longitude", 
  ylab = "latitude", 
  lty = 5, 
  col = "purple", 
  pch = 5, 
  cex = 1.25) 
```
