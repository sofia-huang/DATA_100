## Getting Started with R Studio

Here I created a simple plot using 2 objects, x & y, which contain the numbers 1-10, to generate the points. Then, I made specifications to the plot line and points, as well as adding labels and a title.

## Challenge Question

I created a more advanced plot using various objects. The homes/dwellings are created using a random sample for the x and y coordinates and then plotting them as squares. Then, I plotted two different sized circles at random locations to represent trees. After that, I used a data frame for the home locations and bound the objects east and north (This creates an id, 1 - 50, for each home location). I randomly sampled 7 numbers from 1 - 50 and used them to choose the dwelling locations that will be part of the path. Lastly, I plotted the path with a spline that followed the 7 random dwelling locations and labeled the 7 chosen dwellings.
