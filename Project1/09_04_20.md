## Data Management Foundations
### Application Program Interfaces & Tidying up your Data

Part two of this project involved retrieving data from the Federal Census Bureau using API calls. Then modifying and reformatting the data in order to bind three different years of datasets into one dataframe. Finally, I used ggplot to plot the data to show the facet population total from 2000, 2010, and 2014 in all 50 states and Puerto Rico.
