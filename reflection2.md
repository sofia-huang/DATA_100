### Applications in Environmental Science
-----------
Environmental issues are something we must be very conscious of in today’s world. Finding solutions that are effective and easy to implement is vital to keep our planet healthy. Environmental monitoring is an application of data science that is helping regulators to protect the Earth.
 
One problem we face today is deforestation. Millions of trees are cut down each year from illegal logging and agriculture. This affects many different natural systems that keep the environment stable. Satellite images are being used to track deforestation and identify areas where forests are being destroyed. Orbital Insight is a startup that is using a **deep learning algorithm** to map deforestation for “real-time forest monitoring.” 

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning. It runs data through many layers of neural network algorithms and progressively learns more about the data as it passes through each layer. It works better for unstructured datasets that have more than a few hundred features, such as images which have millions due to each pixel in color. 

This algorithm can inform researchers of future deforestation in time for them to take action before it’s too late by using trends and predictions. It can also help companies assess their risk of deforestation and make changes to reduce their impact on the environment through supply chains. In order to analyze the satellite imagery and radar data they use **convolutional neural networks**.

Neural networks are basically AI “brains” or a computing system of connected nodes or artificial neurons. These nodes can send signals to other nodes much like neurons and their synapses in the brain. The network are a series of algorithms with a purpose of recognizing hidden patterns and relationships within data in a similar way that the human brain operates. The process of deep learning is done using these neural networks. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are “the eyes” of the computer system. They analyze images and identify objects using many layers of processing and functions between the input and output layer to arrive at the final result. 

Pollution is another problem humans face and according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the leading contributor is agriculture. Substantial water pollution is thought to stem from large, concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs). The real issue is, there is no agency with a definite list of CAFOs as they are not regulated. This means they are hard to find and monitor. The solution to this is deep learning. By training algorithms to recognize CAFOs and determine their pollution risk, the model was able to detect 93% of all poultry CAFOs in North Carolina. Researchers hope to implement these models to a larger scale and to compliment regulator agencies’ monitoring efforts.

Environmental monitoring using machine learning is one of the most efficient ways to predict environmental risks and hazards so that agencies can take action before the damage is done. Other applications of this technology include monitoring thawing permafrost and preventing oil and gas leaks. In the future, this will hopefully become a more common practice in efforts to protect the planet from manmade dangers as technology advances and these models become more effective and accurate.
