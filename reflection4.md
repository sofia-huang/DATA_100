### Geographic Information Systems
----------------

GIS stands for Geographic Information System and is a big trend and popular division of data science. Another name for it is spatial data science which is the process of extracting information from spatial data using algorithms and analysis. Spatial data are numeric data about the location of a physical object in a coordinate system. An example would be the latitude and longitude of a house. There are two types of spatial data: raster and vector. These depend on the way the data is stored. Raster models are stored using grid cells, such as satellite images. While vector models use points, lines, and polygons, such as country borders. 

Applications of GIS are able to enhance humanitarian projects. One organization, DigitalGlobe, sources satellite data and created a “GIS machine learning algorithm to track activity in specific locations and identify anomalies.” This is useful in an array of different fields plays a key role in problems such as, global health monitoring, disaster response, and sustainable development. DigitalGlobe has over 18 years worth of imagery archived and adds about 3 million sq km of high resolution data each day! Customers can use this machine learning technology along with the enormous Earth image archive to extract global-scale insights such as coastline change or urbanization. Having this data available makes it easier to see trends and changes year to year. 

DigitalGlobe partnered with Google to create Google Maps and Google Earth. They also made a [story](https://earth.google.com/web/data=CiQSIhIgZDJkMzVhNTk2ZTQ3MTFlOGJhM2Y0ZGJhNDk1NmM3YjQ) using Voyager, a platform that enables interactive, map-based narratives, that shows how the increasing temperature of the Earth is affecting different areas across the globe. Some examples include rising sea levels swallowing islands, growing pine-killing beetle population due to the climate change, melting glaciers, and the appearance of sinkholes from thawing permafrost. The story shows images from different years to demonstrate the effects that climate change is inducing on the environment, as well as, shortwave infrared imagery that is useful when agencies are researching events like fires.
