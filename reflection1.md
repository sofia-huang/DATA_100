# Applications in Agriculture
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Smart farming is a new application of data science within the agriculture industry that uses big data and machine learning to monitor, analyze, and automate operations. This emerging concept is being studied to make agricultural production more efficient. Due to a rising global population, increase in need for sustainable farming, and higher demand for crop yield, this management system is an up and coming method that will change the way agriculture is done. 
      Some interesting applications of smart farming include species management, breeding and recognition. Deep learning algorithms are used to make gene selection much easier by analyzing decades of field data to build a probability model that can predict which genes and characteristics are the most beneficial and desirable in a crop. Machine learning can also be used to classify plants by analyzing the leaf vein morphology which shows more information than simply looking at the physical properties of the plant, such as color or shape.
      By utilizing sensors, satellites, telecommunication technologies, and data analytics, the future of agriculture can be paved as smart farms allow farmers to have a deeper understanding of their fields and better manage them. They can monitor individual animalsâ€™ needs and adjust accordingly to optimize herd health. This new concept can reduce production risks, increase sustainability and efficiency, and gives farmers the ability to foresee results and enhance strategy.
